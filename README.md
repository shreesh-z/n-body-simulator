# n-body-simulator
An N-Body Simulator I'm building using the B-H Tree algorithm.
Right now, it is able to build a B-H quad tree from an array of body objects, and find the forces acting on them by traversing through it.
Further elements of the simulator are also obviously planned, like:
* RK4 integrator
* Plotting with matplotlib or gnuplot
* Animation with pygame

Once the C++ build is finished, I'm planning on implementing the same with python (numpy+pygame) and/or Julia.
